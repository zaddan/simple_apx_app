to build this program follow the following steps:


#--- genrating make files
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ../
note: if cmake has already been run, we might get an error. Hence first
run "rm CmakeCache.txt" and then run "cmake ../"
#--- building the application
cmake --build .

#--- runing the application
    #--- the application gets 3 inputs:
    resultFolderName, resultFile and an operatorFile
    the first two args are self explanatory.
    3rd arg is an file containing the config for each one of the operators
    in the program.
    and example of operatorFile (with the name of operator_sample.txt) is included
    #--- to run:
    ./simple . out ../operator_sample.txt

note: the output of the program is directed to the stdout
